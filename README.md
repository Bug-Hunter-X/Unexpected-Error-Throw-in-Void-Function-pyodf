This repository demonstrates an uncommon TypeScript bug related to error handling in functions with a void return type. The `bug.ts` file shows a function that throws an error despite being declared with `void` return type, which is unconventional behavior. The `bugSolution.ts` file offers a resolution.  The core issue lies in misunderstanding the implications of using `void` return type alongside exception handling. This behavior, while not a syntax error, can lead to unexpected runtime behavior and maintainability issues.
